 * @notice ECOxChunkedLockup contract implements ChunkedVestingVault for the ECOx currency.
 * This contract is funded entirely on creation and follows the same rules as a standard ChunkedVestingVault.
 * The addition is that it is able to stake all funds in ECOxStaking and delegate them to the beneficiary.
 * Then, when vested, funds are undelegated and withdrawn from the ECOxStaking contract before allowing the
 * inherited chunked vault logic to kick in.
 *
 * Due to the vault being completely funded on instantiation, it is able to use delegation by amount.
